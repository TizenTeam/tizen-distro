#
# Machine Selection
#
# You need to select a specific machine to target the build with. There are a selection
# of emulated machines available which can boot and run in the QEMU emulator:
#
#MACHINE ?= "qemux86"
#MACHINE ?= "qemux86-64"
#MACHINE ?= "genericx86"
#
# This sets the default machine to be qemux86 if no other machine is selected:
#MACHINE ??= "genericx86-64"
#
# Default to the Michelle 2+ platform
MACHINE = "michelle2p"

#
# Parallelism Options
#
# These two options control how much parallelism BitBake should use. The first
# option determines how many tasks bitbake should run in parallel:
#
#BB_NUMBER_THREADS ?= "4"
#
# Default to setting automatically based on cpu count
BB_NUMBER_THREADS ?= "${@oe.utils.cpu_count()}"
#
# The second option controls how many processes make should run in parallel when
# running compile tasks:
#
#PARALLEL_MAKE ?= "-j 4"
#
# Default to setting automatically based on cpu count
PARALLEL_MAKE ?= "-j ${@oe.utils.cpu_count()}"
#
# For a quad-core machine, BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "4", PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 4" would
# be appropriate for example.
#

#
# The following are used to control options related to debugging.
#
# Uncomment this to change the optimization to make debugging easer, at the 
# possible cost of performance.

#

#
# Disk space monitor, take action when the disk space or the amount of
# inode is running low, it is enabled when BB_DISKMON_DIRS is set.
#
# Set the directory for the monitor, the format is:
# "action,directory,minimum_space,minimum_free_inode"
#
# The "action" must be set and should be one of:
# ABORT: Immediately abort
# STOPTASKS: The new tasks can't be executed any more, will stop the build
#           when the running tasks have been done.
# WARN: show warnings (see BB_DISKMON_WARNINTERVAL for more information)
#
# The "directory" must be set, any directory is OK.
#
# Either "minimum_space" or "minimum_free_inode" (or both of them)
# should be set, otherwise the monitor would not be enabled,
# the unit can be G, M, K or none, but do NOT use GB, MB or KB
# (B is not needed).
#BB_DISKMON_DIRS = "STOPTASKS,${TMPDIR},1G,100K WARN,${SSTATE_DIR},1G,100K"
#
# Set disk space and inode interval (only works when the action is "WARN",
# the unit can be G, M, or K, but do NOT use the GB, MB or KB
# (B is not needed), the format is:
# "disk_space_interval,disk_inode_interval", the default value is
# "50M,5K" which means that it would warn when the free space is
# lower than the minimum space(or inode), and would repeat the warning
# when the disk space reduces 50M (or the amount of inode reduces 5k).
